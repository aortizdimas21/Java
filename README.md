# Computer Science 111

Inspired by my sister who has a large book collection (600+) and is constantly forgetting whether she already
owns a book so she ends up buying the same book twice (it happens quite often). User must submit a txt file called
book.txt with the information of the books in "title by author" format. For this purpose, books.txt is a sample book list.
Program asks user whether they want to add a book, check if they own it, or just view their current collection. Adding
a book writes the name into the book.txt file that they submitted. Would like to expand to maybe using barcode scanning
to find book information to make it easier for the user to input books information/check if they already own it within
a simple mobile app.
